Description
-----------
Less blocks is a very simple module which allows to disable blocks from the Drupal block list. It comes with a handy settings page (admin/settings/less-blocks) to choose which blocks to remove. 

Why use this module?
--------------------
In some projects you will allow the customer to use blocks because it's an easier system than context. Out of experience we know that customers get confused when there are too much blocks. That is why you want to clear out all the unneccesary blocks. The system blocks like "who's online" and "Powered by Drupal" have no use in some sites.

Important notice
----------------
It's best to set all blocks to a disabled state before using this module. This module simply unsets blocks from the list, it does not tamper with settings in the database.

Roadmap
-------
- Per theme support
- Per role support
- Wildcard regular expressions support (eg. exclude all view blocks)
